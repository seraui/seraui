## 🧹 Adding or Contributing a Component

If you want to **add a new component** or **contribute to an existing one**:

1. Navigate to the `app/` folder.

2. Inside `app/`, go to the `docs/` folder. Every folder inside `docs/` is a component.

3. Create a new folder for your component and add your files.
   ✅ **Make sure your component is unique** — do not copy others.

4. After adding your component, go to the `constants/` folder.

5. Inside it, open `navigation.ts`.

6. Register your component there to make it appear in the sidebar.

That’s it! 🎉

## 😟 A Few Guidelines

* Use clean and readable code.
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Test your component before submitting a pull request.
* Don't forget to open a pull request from your fork when you're ready!

Happy Coding 💙
